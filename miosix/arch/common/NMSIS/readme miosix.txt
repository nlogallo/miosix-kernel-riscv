Changes with respect to upstream NMSIS:

- Removed Makefiles and Scripts
- For GigaDevice/GD32VF103: removed a lot of useless stuff like
  examples, stubs, init scripts, linker scripts, support for USBFS
  and all the unused includes and implementations; these however may
  be useful to add again in case they are needed
